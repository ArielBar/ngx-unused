# ngx-unused
Find declared but unused Angular code.

# Usage 
Simplest way to use is via npx:
`npx ngx-unused <tsconfig-path>`

`<tsconfig-path>` - path to tsconfig file _(note: files excluded in given config will not be analyzed)_

This project is on early stage so using `@latest` version tag is recommended:
`npx ngx-unused@latest <tsconfig-path>`
